[December 1, 2024] - Sprint 3 Standup 3

1) What did you work on since the last standup?
- Integrated user ratings and reviews to the movie details page, enabling users to view and submit feedback.
Improved UI responsiveness, ensuring the app works smoothly on both mobile and desktop screens.

2) What do you commit to next?

- I plan to implement the "watchlist" feature for users to save movies they are interested in. Additionally, I will add a sorting option for search results (e.g., by rating, popularity, or release date).

3) When do you think you'll be done?
- I aim to complete the watchlist and sorting features within the next 2-3 days.

4) Do you have any blockers?
- No significant blockers at the moment, but I may need additional time for testing the sorting algorithms to ensure accuracy and speed.
