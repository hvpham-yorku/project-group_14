      [November 26, 2024] - Sprint 2 # Standup #
      1. What did you work on since the last standup?
      I will be working on the application's social media integration feature.
      2. What do you commit to next? 
      I will be commiting the updated project with the use of social media API's to hopefully have social media integrated.
      3. When do you think you'll be done?
      THis entire feature should take about 4 days to be implemented.
      4. Do you have any blockers?
      I am unsure if the social media integration feature can be implemented as our aplicaiton is serverless.
