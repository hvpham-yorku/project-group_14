      1. What did you work on since the last standup?

      2. What do you commit to next? 
      Will now work on GUI with all movies and implement a search feature
      3. When do you think you'll be done?
      This feature should take 2 working days
      4. Do you have any blockers?
      Collecting movies may be difficult. Maybe implementing the movie manually wouldb be easier.
