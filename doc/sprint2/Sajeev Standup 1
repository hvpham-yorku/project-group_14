[Date: 2024-11-26] - Sprint 2 - Standup 1

What did you work on since the last standup?
I completed the watchlist feature, which allows users to add/remove watchlists and add/remove movies or shows from the list integrated into a local MySQL database. 

What do you commit to next?
I will be working on integrating the database for reviews and movies so that when a review is added for a movie, it is connected to the database.
Additionally, I will work on implementing thumbnails for movies/TV shows using the TMDB API.

When do you think you'll be done?
These tasks will take about 4 days to complete.

Do you have any blockers?
The current project build setup makes it difficult to add thumbnails for movies because dependencies are harder to manage. 
Converting the project to Maven would make handling dependencies such as the TMDB API easier.
