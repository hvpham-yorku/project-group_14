[November 28, 2024] - Sprint 2 Standup 2

1) What did you work on since the last standup?
- Implemented autocomplete suggestions for the search bar, allowing users to see dynamic results as they type.
Added filters for genre, release date, and ratings, enabling refined movie searches.

2) What do you commit to next?
- I will work on integrating user ratings and reviews to the movie details page and enhance UI responsiveness for mobile devices.

3)When do you think you'll be done?
- I expect to complete the user ratings, reviews, and UI responsiveness tasks in 1-2 days.

4) Do you have any blockers?
- I encountered minor delays in optimizing the backend queries for autocomplete suggestions, but it has been resolved now.
