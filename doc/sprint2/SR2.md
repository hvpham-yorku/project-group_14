## Unfinished Tasks
The following tasks from Sprint 2 remain incomplete:

### 2. Homepage
- **User Story**:  
  As a user, I want a homepage that is visually appealing and displays trending movies/shows fetched from the TMDB API.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  - The homepage displays trending content with thumbnails and titles in a grid.  
  - The sidebar navigation seamlessly transitions to the watchlist and other sections.  

### 3. Advanced Search Features
- **User Story**:  
  As a user, I want to search for movies with real-time suggestions, so I can quickly find what Iâ€™m looking for.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  - Real-time suggestions using the TMDB API appear as the user types.  
  - Search results are displayed dynamically with proper formatting.

## Practices to Continue
The following practices worked well in Sprint 2 and should be continued in the next sprint:
- **Frequent Meetings**: Regular team meetings were effective in keeping everyone updated and on track.
- **Frequent Code Reviews**: Features were tested in separate branches before being merged into the main branch, reducing conflicts.

---

## New Practices to Adopt
1. **Early Testing of Features**: Testing will begin earlier in the sprint.
2. **Enhanced Documentation**: Documentation updates will happen incrementally to avoid rushed entries at the end.

---

## Harmful Practices to Stop
1. **Delayed Feature Merging**:  
   Some features were delayed due to late merging, causing integration challenges.  
   **Plan**: Set deadlines for merging feature branches to ensure timely testing.
   
---

## Best Experiences
- **API Integration**: Successfully integrated TMDB API for fetching thumbnails and trending content.
- **Team Collaboration**: The team worked together effectively to debug complex issues, particularly with watchlist integration.

---

## Worst Experiences
- **UI Bugs**: Persistent bugs in the watchlist UI, especially with delete button and thumbnail features.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Ensuring real-time updates between reviews and watchlists was more challenging than anticipated.
