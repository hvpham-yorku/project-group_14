[November 26, 2024] - Sprint 2 Standup 1

1. What did you work on since the last standup?
   - Worked on implementing the movie search functionality. Set up the basic search bar UI and connected it to the backend to fetch movie data based on title, genre, and actor. 

2. What do you commit to next?
   - I will be working on implementing autocomplete suggestions for the search bar and integrating filters for genre, release date, and ratings.

3. When do you think you'll be done?
   - I estimate that the autocomplete feature and the filter functionality will be done in the next 1-2 days.

4. Do you have any blockers?
   - No blockers at the moment, everything is proceeding as planned.
