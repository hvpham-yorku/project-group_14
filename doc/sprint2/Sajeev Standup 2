[Date: 2024-11-29] - Sprint 2 - Standup 2
What did you work on since the last standup?
I integrated the reviews and watchlist tables in the database. I removed redundant ratings input from the watchlist UI and dynamically added average ratings from the reviews table.
Also, I implemented a filter for reviews specific to a selected movie or show. Double-clicking the movie opens the reviews page instead of a single click so it doesn't interfere with
the delete function. All changes are added to the review-and-watchlist-updates branch.

What do you commit to next?
I will implement thumbnails for movies/TV shows using the TMDB API.

When do you think you'll be done?
I think Iâ€™ll finish in about 3 days.

Do you have any blockers?
I had some bugs when changing the code in the watchlist, such as the delete button not working and debugging the real-time rating feature.
