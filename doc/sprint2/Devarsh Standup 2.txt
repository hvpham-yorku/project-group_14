[November 29, 2024] - Sprint 2 Standup 2

1. What did you work on since the last standup?
   - Finalized the autocomplete feature for the search bar and added genre and release date filters. Integrated them with the backend to display search results dynamically.

2. What do you commit to next?
   - I will focus on refining the search results page, ensuring it displays movie posters, ratings, and brief synopses for each result.

3. When do you think you'll be done?
   - I expect to finish refining the search results page within the next day.

4. Do you have any blockers?
   - No blockers, but I might need assistance later with styling the search results for consistency across different devices.
