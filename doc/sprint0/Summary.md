A fullstack AI chatbot web application that has its backend powered with Java's Spring Boot Framework
along side JavaScripts's React.js for frontend. The database utilized for storing user authentication information
and user sided messages will be MySQL. The Chatbot will allow users to enter prompts and will return a relevant message.

 ### Architectural Pattern Used: MVC

 ## Key Users:
 The chatbot is aimed towards anyone and has a universal target audience. However, some key users that might use the app would include:
   #### Students: A college student who is taking multiple classes this semester and its currently midterm season. He has multiple midterms to study for, assignments to finish, labs to participate, and meetings to attend. Since his schedule is packed, he has very little time to properly study and wishes he has a study buddy by his side whenever he needed.
   #### Teachers: A teacher is preparing a test for her grade 7 class. Along with her grade 7 class, she is currently the homeroom teacher of 4 other classes who she has to prepare excercise booklets for and also prepare for the monthly assembly coming up next week. On top of this she is also balancing her daily lifely situations and has very little time to prepare a test for her grade 7 class but has the criteria and guildines of the test all ready.
   #### Employees: An employee is asked by his boss to use Microsoft Excel to form a balance sheet of the monthly cash flow of the company. He has little experience with Excel but needs some help filling the gaps and is afraid he might upset his boss if he turns down his assignment. His fellow co-workers are all busy with their own tasks to help him out and he doesn't have enough time to scour the web or watch videos on the topic.

  ## Key Use Cases:
 Since this is an AI chatbot that will be powered by Google's Gemini Model. It can input any request a user enters. To list some use cases:
- Study help
- Teaching topics
- Quick calculations
- Chat with user in general
- Debating

  ## Key Usage Scenarios:
 The main use case for the chatbot will be to provide users with quick assistance in time of rush and stress. The chatbot will always be availabe to accept the users needs and criteria to output a helpful suggestion.
 To extend lets use the Key Users scenarios.
   #### Students: The student has to prepare for an upcoming midterm for his Object Oriented Programming class and doesn't seem to quite grasp the concept on encapsulation. His notes and class recordings are not too helpful either, he uses the chatbot to generate some practice problems related to encapsulation and generate relevent analogies to help him better understand the topic.
   #### Teachers: The teacher really has to prepare this test for her grade 7 class and the date of the test is swiftly approaching. Since she has the guildlines with all the questions and topics that are to be included on thes test, she enters the criteria onto the chatbot and the chatbot outputs a sample test sheet she may use or alter if she feels the need to.
   #### Employees: The employee needs some re-polishing on his Excel skills and needs to learn some new skills and syntax to fill in the gaps he posseses to complete his task. Since he does not have time to watch a whole video or blindly search the web to hopefully find help, he has a rough idea of tools he may need and asks the chatbot for help with the certain skills he needs help with.
