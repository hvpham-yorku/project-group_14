# Process

### Team Collaboration

During Sprint 0, our team focused on establishing roles and setting a foundation for collaboration. Each member identified their strengths, and we assigned preliminary roles in areas such as backend development, frontend design, natural language processing, and testing. This setup phase allowed us to align our expectations and create a structure that will guide us as we begin the main project work.

### Tools Used for Organisation and Collaboration

To organize tasks and communication, we selected **Discord** for real-time updates and **Trello** to manage user stories and task breakdowns. We also set up **GitHub** repositories to handle version control once development begins. These tools were chosen based on their effectiveness in previous projects and familiarity within the team, ensuring everyone is comfortable as we move forward.

### Decision-Making Process

In Sprint 0, our decisions centered on project planning, particularly in choosing tools, defining roles, and establishing an initial roadmap. We used a consensus-based approach for each decision, allowing all members to share their insights and agree on the best direction. For example, we discussed various platforms and agreed on GitHub for version control based on its collaborative features and flexibility.

### Defining Priorities and Estimating Points

For this initial sprint, we defined the project's core goals and created high-level user stories, without yet diving into point estimation or prioritization.

### Meeting Frequency

We held **two planning meetings** during this sprint to establish roles, review project goals, and agree on tools and workflows. As we move into development, we plan to meet twice or thrice weekly for updates and progress checks, with ad-hoc meetings as needed for any urgent discussions via **Discord**.

### Lessons Learned for Future Phases

- **Clear Communication**: Establishing clear communication channels early has been helpful, and we aim to maintain this as we move forward.
- **Planning and Flexibility**: Laying out a roadmap before starting development has clarified our goals, but we remain open to adjusting our plan based on new insights during the project.
- **Agile Mindset**: As we move into the development phase, we intend to incorporate Agile principles, with regular sprints and user feedback guiding our iterations.
