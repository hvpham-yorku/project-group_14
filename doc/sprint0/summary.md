# Summary

## Obective: 
A fullstack movie rating web application that has its backend powered with Java's Spring Boot Framework
along side JavaScripts's React.js for frontend. The database utilized for storing user authentication information
and user sided messages will be MySQL. The app will allow users to log recent movies or shows they have watched and post reviews about them similiar to social media apps. This app saves the users times when searching for movies since they have all the ratings of all their desired movies all in one place.

 ### Architectural Pattern Used: MVC

 ## Key Users:
 The web application will be specially catered towards movie and show fans who want to spend more time watching rather than searching and deciding. Some include:
   #### Students: A college student who is just finished with all of his midterms and chooses to relax by watching Anime. He has been wanting to start on the hit anime title, "One Piece" but is intimidated by its length, he wants to know if it is something he will like.
   #### Movie Fan: A movie fan of a certain series is doubtful of the new inclusion of his favorite franchise. He wants to know whether or not watching the new 2.5 hour movie will be a good investment of his time.
   #### New Series Watcher: A person was recommended to watch a certain movie because he was told "you will like it, because you liked...". He wants to check the validity of that hypothesis by comparing the reviews and ratings on both titles and seeing if there truly is a correlation.

  ## Key Use Cases:
 Some of the main Key Use Cases that Rateflix will contain are: 
- Saving time deciding between multiple movies
- Search titles that intrigue you
- Figure out whether or not to watch something
- Keep eye on hot trending movies 

## Key Usage Scenarios:
The Key Usage Scenarios are linked with the use cases and key users. To extend lets use the Key Users scenarios.
   #### Students: The student found out "One Piece" has over 1000 episodes with each episode spanning around 20 minutes. He also is a person who doesnt like to leave titles unfinished and once he starts something, he has to finish it. This is a big decision for him as this series is incredibly time consuming and he is no quiter. Having a way to read reviews and comparisons to similiar titles would be incredibly helpful as this would give him a rough idea of what to expect before diving in.
   #### Movie Fan: Since he is an avid fan of the franchise, the new release title has him nervous. He wishes nothing but success for the franchise but he is afraid this new title might be a dissapointment. He does not want to watch a movie that may possibly ruin his entire outlook on the franchise and ruin his perspective of the legacy. Having reviews and live ratings would help him whether he should save 2.5 hours and invest in something perhaps more productive.
   #### New Series Watcher: He loves the series he came from but is told this series is similiar to it. Having an application that allows him to view both ratings and compare them would prove incredibly useful.
