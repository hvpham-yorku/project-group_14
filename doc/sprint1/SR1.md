## **Unfinished Tasks**
The following tasks from Sprint 1 remain incomplete and will be carried forward to Sprint 2 as new or updated user stories in the Product Backlog (**PB.md**):

1. **Movie Search Functionality**  
   **User Story:**  
   - As a user, I want to search for movies by title, genre, or actor so that I can find my favorite movies and discover new ones.  
   **Acceptance Criteria:**  
   - A search bar with autocomplete suggestions.  
   - Filters to refine search results by genre, release date, or ratings.  

   **Notes:** Search is partially implemented, stuck on integrating the search logic and linking it to database.

2. **Connecting Movies to Reviews**  
   **User Story:**  
   - As a user, I want to see and add reviews for individual movies in my watchlist so that I can better understand others' opinions.  
   **Acceptance Criteria:**  
   - Reviews are linked to specific movies in the database.  
   - Each movie displays user reviews in a dedicated section.

   **Notes:** The reviews are working but only partially, as they have not yet been linked to specific movies on a watchlist.

3. **Image Representation for Movies**  
   **User Story:**  
   - *As a user, I want to see a poster or thumbnail for each movie in my watchlist so that the interface feels more engaging and informative.*  
   **Acceptance Criteria:**  
   - Each movie/show entry in the watchlist displays an image fetched from an API.

## **Practices to Continue**
The following practices worked well in Sprint 1 and should be continued in the next sprint:

1. **Frequent Meetings**
   - Regular team meetings on discord were effective for discussing progress and planning next steps.

2. **Frequent Code Pushes and Use of Separate Branches**
   - Every feature was tested and reviewed before merging into the main branch.

## **New Practices to Adopt**
To improve the workflow,  the following new practices will be adopted for Sprint 2:

1. **Improved Communication Outside of Meetings**
   - Communication outside of meetings was inconsistent. 
   - **Plan:** Establish daily check-ins on discord to keep everyone in sync.
---

## **Harmful Practices to Stop**
1. **Lack of Communication Outside of Meetings**
   - Lack of communication outside meetings led to unresolved task, and even less clarity about who was doing what. Certain team members failed to request assistance or seek clarity on their responsibilities.
   - **Plan:** Establish daily check-ins on discord to keep everyone in sync.
2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Documentation was rushed towards the end of the sprint. Moving forward, documentation will be updated during the sprint to avoid last-minute stress.  
   - **Plan:** Assign one team member a document to work throughout the week.

## **Best Experiences**
1. **Seamless Feature Integration**
   - Successfully integrating major features like user authentication, watchlists, and reviews was a highlight of Sprint 1. Collaboration between team members ensured that these features worked together without major conflicts.

2. **Team Collaboration**
   - Team members worked well together to troubleshoot issues, especially in syncing databases and frontend components.

---

## **Worst Experiences**
1. **Documentation Process**
   - Documentation details were written in a rush with missing or vague entries. This meant that there were also a relatively large number of paperwork which created some additional pressure to juggle alongside feature development.

2. **Blockers in Search Functionality**
   - Search functionality is quite challenging to implement, with database queries and filter integration being significantly delayed
