# Rateflix

## Motivation
##### Welcome to Rateflix. A serverless window application.
##### The purpose of this web app is to play the role as a social media rating app for movies, shows, serials, etc. Users are able to create posts of recent movies or work they've seen and write a quick review and rate it. Other users are able to see these posts to help them decide whether they should watch it or not.
##### Some of the problems this application solves is helping users save time deciding what movie to watch by showing them a quick rundown of each title all in one place.
##### Some general purposes and objectives of the project are outlined in the ``` summary.md ``` file.

## Installation
##### cd into the Rateflix directory and create a 'config.properties' file under Database package. Populate the file with the following:
    db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/rateflix
    db.username=[yourUsername (typically 'root')]
    db.password=[yourPassword]
##### This should set you up with the database.
##### further installations of tools and libraries will be added onto this ``` README.md ``` file once they are implemented.

## Contribution
##### When creating a new branch, name it using your name using the format "firstName_LastName" to make it easier to identify.
##### We will be using GitHub issues for task distribution and issue handling. This will be easier given the code organization software used for this is on GitHub.
##### Pull requests will be enabled to main contributors ONLY initially, with future expansions later in the future.
